DPDK compilation
=================

compile DPDK with -fPIC, CONFIG_RTE_BUILD_COMBINE_LIBS=y and -fvisibility=hidden.
This should build libintel_dpdk.a.

for DPDK 1.7.1:
make install T=x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc CONFIG_RTE_BUILD_COMBINE_LIBS=y EXTRA_CFLAGS="-fPIC" -j8

Ideally, we would also put "-fvisibility=hidden" in the EXTRA_CFLAGS, but other PMDs need the visibility.

(thanks to libtrace for figuring out flags for PIC, https://github.com/wanduow/libtrace/wiki/DPDK-Notes---Experimental)


With PCAP support:
for pcap support compile DPDK also with CONFIG_RTE_LIBRTE_PMD_PCAP=y i.e.,

make install T=x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc CONFIG_RTE_BUILD_COMBINE_LIBS=y CONFIG_RTE_LIBRTE_PMD_PCAP=y EXTRA_CFLAGS="-fPIC" -j8
